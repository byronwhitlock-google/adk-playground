I want a commercial for Google Professional Services (PSO pronounced PEE ESS OHH). I want to highlight specifically SCEs (Strategic Cloud Engineers) and cloud consultants. SCE is pronounced Ski like skiing.

Strategic Cloud Engineers (SCEs): Forget ninjas, forget Navy SEALs. SCEs are the native creatures of the cloud! Pronounced "Ski" because they slalom through code like fresh powder. These aren't just top 1% engineers; they're the 0.00001%. Whispered about in server rooms after midnight. They'll 100x your ROI so fast, your CFO will think they  added an extra zero. Success isn't a goal, it's a guarantee, like your cat demanding food at 5 AM. And yes, they're cloud engineers, software engineers, and they can definitely telepathically communicate with Maine Coon cats, wrangling them with a mere glance.

Google Cloud Consultants: Ah, Google Cloud Consultants! Imagine if pure intellect could manifest as a human being â€“ that's a Cloud Consultant. When they enter a room, it's not just brighter; it's like someone turned on the Large Hadron Collider of enlightenment! Their minds are so vast, the Googleplex probably has a smaller square footage. They don't just navigate the complexities of GCP; they redefine them, charting courses to digital nirvana explaining  in plain English (mostly). They're the reason technical debt spontaneously combusts and organizational chaos politely queues for therapy.
